## Introduction: The Ukulele App
The Ukulele App is regarded as one of the top Ukulele learning apps by a variety of blogs, Youtube channels, and Ukulele players. The app's reliability and credibility is primarily established upon the credentials of its founder--The Ukulele Teacher--a Youtuber with over 1.4 million subscribers. The app features a catalog of The Ukulele Teacher's video tutorials, lessons about the basics of learning the Ukulele, as well as tools such as a tuner and chord library. The main source of music-learning content is video tutorials. 

Through the process of conducting a heuristic evaluation, I identified a few issues that I believed stood out as major design and usability concerns:
| Heuristic | Usability Concern | Usability Test Task | How the Task Address the Concern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Match Between System + Real World | Many of the "tools" featured on the app are extremely unintuitive to users, but particularly for beginners. The instructions and tips for the function of each tool is not immediately accessible and can even be difficult to locate. More importantly, it implements controls that do not mimic a real world instrument. For example, you have to swipe up and down to view variations of a chord and tap on a string to strum the note. | Navigate to the "chord library" tool and review three variations of the D minor chord. | This task explores how users process and utilize the tools. If confusion or inability to manage the tool occurs, this indicates the necessity of a redesign for a more intuitive interface. |
| Error Prevention | It is unclear where to begin with the music learning process. Main menu sections/categories do not clearly define their contents, and the search function does not contain any recommendations, suggestions, or clues as to what is searchable. Spelling errors and typos raise a huge issue as well, as they produce error messages rather than suggestions for similar searches. | Locate a video tutorial by a specific artist | "Surfin' USA" by the Beach Boys was chosen in hopes of prompting a typo of "Surfin USA" or "Surfing USA" rather than "Surfin' USA"). If an error occurs, this task will provide insight into how users recover from error, and how it these errors affect their ability to complete tasks. |
| Visibility of System Status | For many pages, it is unclear which section you are currently interacting with. Section titles such as "Videos" or Lessons" do not remain visible if you progress to a sub-section within it, allowing for confusion when attempting to navigate somewhere else. | After viewing a tutorial for "Surfin' USA", find and view a tutorial for a more challenging song. | The intended task is for the user to switch from the "Videos" category to the "Lessons" category after completing the prior task. This task is implemented to investigate how users switch from one feature/task to another. If the user encounters an error when switching, it indicates that they may have gotten lost in the navigation process. This calls for a redesign of visibility of system status. | 
## Methodology
The pilot usability test will be conducted via Zoom. The moderator is located in Los Angeles, CA while the participant is located in Arcadia, CA. The participant will mirror their iPhone screen via Quicktimer and share this mirrored iPhone screen using the Zoom screen share function. The participant's video and audio will be observed. The entirety of the session will be recorded by the moderator using Zoom screen/audio recording. The moderator will introduce the purpose of the session, ask for informed consent, and begin recording the session.  
This usability test is a pilot usability test. The contents (in order) include:
- Introduction
- Informed Consent
- Background Questions
- Pre-Test Questions
- Task 1 testing 'Match Between System + Real World' heuristic
- Task 2 testing 'Error Prevention' heuristic
- Task 3 testing 'Visibility of System Status' heuristic
- Post-Test Questions
    - Evaluation questions (difficulty, efficiency, likelihood of use)
    - [System Usability Satisfaction Questionnaire](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)
- [Production Satisfaction Card](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microsoft-desirability-toolkit/)
- Demographic Questions
