## Introduction: The Ukulele App
The Ukulele App is regarded as one of the top Ukulele learning apps by a variety of blogs, Youtube channels, and Ukulele players. The app's reliability and credibility is primarily established upon the credentials of its founder--The Ukulele Teacher--a Youtuber with over 1.4 million subscribers. The app features a catalog of The Ukulele Teacher's video tutorials, lessons about the basics of learning the Ukulele, as well as tools such as a tuner and chord library. The main source of music-learning content is video tutorials. 

Through the process of conducting a heuristic evaluation, I identified a few issues that I believed stood out as major design and usability concerns:
| Heuristic | Usability Concern | Usability Test Task | How the Task Address the Concern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Match Between System + Real World | Many of the "tools" featured on the app are extremely unintuitive to users, but particularly for beginners. The instructions and tips for the function of each tool is not immediately accessible and can even be difficult to locate. More importantly, it implements controls that do not mimic a real world instrument. For example, you have to swipe up and down to view variations of a chord and tap on a string to strum the note. | Navigate to the "chord library" tool and review three variations of the D minor chord. | This task explores how users process and utilize the tools. If confusion or inability to manage the tool occurs, this indicates the necessity of a redesign for a more intuitive interface. |
| Error Prevention | It is unclear where to begin with the music learning process. Main menu sections/categories do not clearly define their contents, and the search function does not contain any recommendations, suggestions, or clues as to what is searchable. Spelling errors and typos raise a huge issue as well, as they produce error messages rather than suggestions for similar searches. | Locate a video tutorial by a specific artist | "Surfin' USA" by the Beach Boys was chosen in hopes of prompting a typo of "Surfin USA" or "Surfing USA" rather than "Surfin' USA"). If an error occurs, this task will provide insight into how users recover from error, and how it these errors affect their ability to complete tasks. |
| Visibility of System Status | For many pages, it is unclear which section you are currently interacting with. Section titles such as "Videos" or Lessons" do not remain visible if you progress to a sub-section within it, allowing for confusion when attempting to navigate somewhere else. | After viewing a tutorial for "Surfin' USA", find and view a tutorial for a more challenging song. | The intended task is for the user to switch from the "Videos" category to the "Lessons" category after completing the prior task. This task is implemented to investigate how users switch from one feature/task to another. If the user encounters an error when switching, it indicates that they may have gotten lost in the navigation process. This calls for a redesign of visibility of system status. | 
## Methodology
The pilot usability test was conducted via Zoom. The moderator was located in Los Angeles, CA while the participant was located in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA. The participant mirrored their iPhone screen via Quicktimer to their Macbook Pro and shareed this mirrored iPhone screen using the Zoom screen share function. The participant's video and audio was observed. The entirety of the session was recorded by the moderator using Zoom screen/audio recording. The moderator introduced the purpose of the session and asked for informed consent before beginning the recording of the session. The participant completed the three tasks on their iPhone. After, the moderator shared their own screen of the post-task questionnaires, reading aloud the questions and options. The participant verbally responded to each prompt, and the moderator documented their responses on a Google Form. The session recording ended prior to the demographic questions.

This usability test is a pilot usability test. The contents (in order) includes:
- Introduction
- Informed Consent
- Background Questions
- Pre-Test Questions
- Task 1 testing 'Match Between System + Real World' heuristic
- Task 2 testing 'Error Prevention' heuristic
- Task 3 testing 'Visibility of System Status' heuristic
- Post-Test Questions
    - Evaluation questions (difficulty, efficiency, likelihood of use)
    - [System Usability Satisfaction Questionnaire](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)
- [Production Satisfaction Card](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microsoft-desirability-toolkit/)
- Demographic Questions

## Reflection
I've had experience moderating a cognitive walkthrough for a group of Psych 124B students in the past, however I still found this process to be difficult. It can be hard to articulate your instructions and answer the participant's questions without influencing how they behave throughout the process. Having a fully detailed and fleshed out script was very helpful in preventing any slips, however the moderating process itself was still rather stressful. This pilot test was very useful in gaining a sense of appropriate time for a usability test. When designing my study materials, I anticipated that it would go much quicker--however this was influenced by my familiarity with the app. I realized that it takes a new user much more time to read instructions/pop-ups or analyze a page when they are seeing it for the first time. I learned that it is important to anticipate awkward silences while a user attempts to figure out their next steps, and to be conscious to not influence/interfere with their thought process. Despite my stress about the moderating process, I felt that it went relatively smoothly. I found helpful evidence of usability concerns and results that aligned with my heuristic analysis predictions. 

One instance that was particularly difficult to navigate was when my participant was unable to complete the third task. Since this is a pilot test, I am able to use this conflict to edit my task 3 instructions to hopefully present a more straightforward task. However, it also provides insight into the design and usability errors that I hoped to analyze--The lack of indicators about where the user is and where they should navigate to to discover new content makes it very difficult for users to switch between tasks. Many of the features and content lack discoverability, which may be partially contributed to lack of visibility of system status. If participants are unable to locate where they are, it is difficult to know where they should go next.

Throughout the process, my participant noted a number of usability concerns that I had also identified in my prior heuristic analysis. For example, he noted that the search function was very error-prone and the tools (chord library) was unintuitive. He stated that he was only able to complete the chord library task because he accidentially discovered one of the controls through trial and error. In addition, he described the app with negative adjectives such as cheap, and unprofessional. Many of the silences stemmed from unintuitive controls and features that diverged from industry standards. For example, he had difficulty closing the help page that automatically pops up (the user must tap on the head rather than clicking an x icon). He also expressed frustration with the lack of suggestions or helpful features for the search function. In general, these verbally expressed concerns as well as physical indications of an unintuitive interface suggest that the Ukulele App has many areas for improvement.
