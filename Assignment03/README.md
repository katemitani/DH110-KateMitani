## Step 1: Specify the Research Goals and Requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the user?
- This project would support users in efficiently and effectively learning music and an instrument.
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? 
- This project fulfilles the user's basic needs of esteem and cognition. In terms of esteem, acquiring and succeeding at a new skill can provide a sense of achievement that boosts an individual's self esteem. The process can reassure users that they are smart and capable people. In terms of cognitive needs, learning an instrument can provide a sense of creativity and meaning to one's life. It can be a form of education to fulfill the desire to attain knowledge.
### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- Many music learners pay in-person lessons with instructors. These can be taken at studios, music centers, schools, or with individual music teachers. 
- There are other options such as paid online-courses or virtual instruction.
- Youtube is another option for a variety of free tutorials. Many individuals have utilized Youtube to pick up a new skill. 
### What are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
- One common limitation of music lessons is the cost factor. Learning an instrument requires time--this means paying for repeated lessons over a relatively long period of time. In addition, in person lessons require users to take time out of their day to commute to a specific location. A free mobile phone app can eliminate the burden of cost as well as provide more accessibility to music learning. 
- While Youtube tutorials may solve the cost problem, they remove the structure and curriculum that traditional music lessons offer. A free app could combine the cost effectiveness of Youtube tutorials and the structured format of music lessons by offering a well designed series of tutorials and course materials. 

## Step 2: Target users
### What are the characteristics of users?
- **Demographics**: middled aged adult men (age 35-60)
- **Preferences**: in the process of learning a string instrument (preferably Ukulele) as a hobby/interest
- **Expertise**: users who are still in the process of learning (anyone who is not an expert). Can also be users who have experience with learning an instrument in the past and are searching for a reintroduction to music learning. 
### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
- Users would likely be learnining music independently from their own home, or possibly in in-person individual or group lessons. 
### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
- Generally in a lesson or during practice, a user would first tune their instrument to see if it is ready for use. Once this is complete, they would likely begin with warmups. This could be tied with practicing, reviewing, or learning chords and techniques. The remainder of their time would be likely be spent on applying their skills and learning new songs.

## Step 3: Qualitative Research Method
- I chose to utilize active, overt observation such that participants were aware of the observation and were willing to interact with me to discuss their activities, routines, etc. The particular research method was a contextual inquiry conducted via Zoom. The participant was located in their home where they practice the ukulele. 
- The session was audio recorded using zoom and transcribed by hand. 
- For the participatory observation, I asked the participant to walk me through 3 activities, with the final activity being optional depending on their habits:
  1. Walk me through the first steps you would take before beginning a ukulele practice session.
  2. Walk me through the process of how you would learn a particular song.

### Some interesting  quotes and insights:
- The user has had experience with both music lessons and self-taught techniques such as Youtube. Acknowledges that Youtube/digital content is very accessible.  
> I was learning music before the internet was really a thing for [learning] music, and as a result, my experience learning music was isolated to just my music teachers. If I had to give an answer I would say Youtube, because…everything is available. I imagine that’s also the case for other instruments as well. <br/> 
- While physical products provide more accurate results, digital products are convenient, accessible, and cheap.  
> I think I would still prefer to have a dedicated ukulele tuner. For the period of time [that I had a real tuner] I used the tuner and it was simply more convenient and more accurate because sometimes an app can be finicky and it’s difficult to filter out background noise. So am I satisfied with it…I would say yes, just because of the convenience to open my phone and have it on my person at all times. And also it was free so there was no cost to me… but it’s definitely not the same as a real tuner. <br/>
- More specific to this user (but possibly for other self-taught users as well) tracking progress is difficult to do due to the lack of a linear structure to self-taught techniques.  
> To be frank, I don’t keep track of my progress in any meaningful way. I just kind of do this for myself. And the way I practice is not necessarily conducive to any sort of linear progress. There is no linearity to the difficulty of the songs that I play…versus that generally being the pedagogy for learning an instrument from scratch, like if you were to pick up an instrument for the first time and going to lessons, usually they would start you with basic stuff and progress you to more difficult things. <br/>
- In-person instruction provides the presence and input of another set of eyes and ears. The user deems this an inrreplaceable feature that self-taught and digital techniques/products cannot replicate.   
> [The internet] can’t substitute face to face interaction, and having a person look at you and tell you what you’re doing wrong or how you can improve it. At the end of the day, if you’re self taught it’s a lot of self recognition and self discipline about what you’re doing wrong, which is very difficult to do. Instructors are definitely irreplaceable in regards to learning.  <br/>
## Step 6: Reflection
I personally liked the contextual inquiry process a lot less than the usability testing process. To begin, the process of finding a user so specific to the demographic was a very difficult and almost uncomfortable task. The process is rather extensive and requires a lot of attention, so I felt bad asking someone I barely knew to take 40 minutes out of their day to answer questions and discuss their habits. The process of writing the script and transcribing the video was also extremely time consuming. In the future, I think I should have given myself a lot more time to find a participant, since a few days notice is stressful for myself and the participant. 

Once these concerns were out of the way, I think I was able to achieve some interesting insights from my participant. My participant was unique in that he had a ton of musical experience with the piano, but not the ukulele. This meant some of my results may have been skewed in that it wouldn't necessarily align with an average user of the Ukulele App. However, his extensive insight on music learning and self-taught techniques allowed for great insight into what users may require for an effective lesson/session. For example, his note about the irreplaceable aspect of in-person instructors suggests a potential need for a consultation/personal instruction feature on a music learning app. In addition, I was pleased to hear him mention his use of digital products/services due to the ease of accessibility as well as the low-cost factor.  

One concern was that the user was aware that these questions were in regards to improving the Ukulele App due to the discussions that inevitably happened as a result of how I located and selected a participant. However, the user was not aware of the specific features or usabiltity insights I hope to focus on for this project. Rather, it is helpful that I was able to see which features of the app he used. As someone who is relatively new to understanding the contextual inquiry process, I was also a little concerned that I was asking the wrong questions. Specifically, I hope that my three tasks were effective in providing good insight related to my specified design challenges and research goals. In the future I would like to do a bit more research on the different methods of contextual inquiry and see if there were any adjustments I could have made to my material or process in order to reveal more useful insights.
