## Step 1: Specify the Research Goals and Requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the user?
- This project would support users in efficiently and effectively learning music and an instrument.
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? 
- This project fulfilles the user's basic needs of esteem and cognition. In terms of esteem, acquiring and succeeding at a new skill can provide a sense of achievement that boosts an individual's self esteem. The process can reassure users that they are smart and capable people. In terms of cognitive needs, learning an instrument can provide a sense of creativity and meaning to one's life. It can be a form of education to fulfill the desire to attain knowledge.
### what are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- Many music learners pay in-person lessons with instructors. These can be taken at studios, music centers, schools, or with individual music teachers. 
- There are other options such as paid online-courses or virtual instruction.
- Youtube is another option for a variety of free tutorials. Many individuals have utilized Youtube to pick up a new skill. 
### what are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
- One common limitation of music lessons is the cost factor. Learning an instrument requires time--this means paying for repeated lessons over a relatively long period of time. In addition, in person lessons require users to take time out of their day to commute to a specific location. A free mobile phone app can eliminate the burden of cost as well as provide more accessibility to music learning. 
- While Youtube tutorials may solve the cost problem, they remove the structure and curriculum that traditional music lessons offer. A free app could combine the cost effectiveness of Youtube tutorials and the structured format of music lessons by offering a well designed series of tutorials and course materials. 

## Step 2: Target users
### What are the characteristics of users?
- **Demographics**: middled aged adult men (age 35-60)
- **Preferences**: in the process of learning a string instrument (preferably Ukulele) as a hobby/interest
- **Expertise**: users who are beginners/novices or still in the process of learning. can also be users who have experience with learning an instrument in the past and are searching for a reintroduction to music learning. 
### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
- Users would likely be learnining music independently from their own home, or possibly in in-person individual or group lessons. 
### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
- Generally in a lesson or during practice, a user would first tune their instrument to see if it is ready for use. Once this is complete, they would likely begin with warmups. This could be tied with practicing, reviewing, or learning chords and techniques. The remainder of their time would be likely be spent on applying their skills and learning new songs.

## Step 3: Qualitative Research Method
### By covert / overt observation
- I chose to utilize active, overt observation such that participants were aware of the observation and were willing to interact with me to discuss their activities, routines, etc. The particular research method was a contextual inquiry conducted via Zoom.
