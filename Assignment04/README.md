## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows for designers and researchers to put themselves in the shoes of an average user. Creating personas requires utilizing the information and insights collected from prior research (interviews, user studies, etc.) to illustrate a character with personality traits, background, and goals. Having these specific characters in mind helps a research and design team stay on the same page throughout their process. 

## Design Features
- A notebook feature that allows users to store notes and sheet music for songs they're learning or have learned in the past.
  - This would allow for users to keep track of progress as well as have easy accessibility to material to learn or review songs.
- A chord library that allows you to group and favorite chords to save for later.
  - There are a ton of variations of each chord (e.g. C major has 32 variations!).
  - Rather than searching through all variations to find the right chord each time, this function would allow you to favorite a chord variation and even group it with other chord variations, which can be useful when reviewing and learning new songs.

## Scenarios and Journey Maps
### James' Scenario & Journey Map
**WHY James is using this product**
> James is currently working a 9 to 5 job as a physical therapist--an approximately 35 minute commute from home. He loves his role as a husband and father, and is excited for the memories ahead with his wife and 8 year old son. However, recently, by both personal decision and doctors' advice, James has decided to pick up a hobby to help him destress after work. He recalls all the fun he had learning instruments with his friends back in college, and decides to pick up the ukulele again. James has a lot going on with work and his family, so is in search of an easy/intuitive and low-stress environment when practicing the ukulele. His goal is to play at least 15 minutes a day after work, so he also requires an efficient way to pick up where he left off each practice session.  <br/>

**HOW James is using this product**
> James' coworker recommends to him the Ukulele App, suggesting that it is an efficient way to keep track of notes, sheet music, tutorials, etc. as all the necessary materials are on a single app. James decides to test the app out after he has had dinner and settled in after work. He goes to his office to find a quiet place to practice. He opens the app and decides to begin with learning chords. He locates a few video tutorials and watches them fully. When he finds a tutorial he likes, he decides to add it to his notebook. He taps the notebook icon in the upper right corner. A popup displays, requiring user input for the desired notebook he would like to add the entry to, the date, and any additional notes/descriptions. Once the notebook is formed and his entry is added, he navigates to the notebook to add typed and/or handwritten notes about lessons he struggled with or topics he wants to practice more.


- notebook
  - James has been on and off with practicing the ukulele. His kid is now in first grade and past the toddler stage, so he has a bit more time to himself. He recalls he had learned songs by teaching himself on youtube, but he now has no recollection of which ones and no access to the sheet music. His friend recommends him the Ukulele App and notes that he can learn songs and chords while tracking his progress. The app is an easy way to keep all his materials in one place. 
  - Because he wants to come back to it everyday, he needs something that is easily accessible and easy to pick up where you left off
- Chord library:
  - He has trouble remembering all the chords that he needs for the songs he is learning
  - Son recommended him the app 
  - learning to pass the time after retirement
  - is very new to learning an instrument and can't remember where to place his fingers. overwhelemed by having to learn to read sheet music, memorize chord progressions, finger placement, and strumming techniques
