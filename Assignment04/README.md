## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows for designers and researchers to put themselves in the shoes of an average user. Creating personas requires utilizing the information and insights collected from prior research (interviews, user studies, etc.) to illustrate a character with personality traits, background, and goals. Having these specific characters in mind helps a research and design team stay on the same page throughout their process. 

## Design Features
- A notebook feature that allows users to store notes and sheet music for songs they're learning or have learned in the past.
  - This would allow for users to keep track of progress as well as have easy accessibility to material to learn or review songs.
- A simplified chord library that allows you to group and favorite chords to save for later.
  - There are a ton of variations of each chord (e.g. C major has 32 variations!).
  - Rather than searching through all variations to find the right chord each time, this function would allow you to favorite a chord variation and even group it with other chord variations, which can be useful when reviewing and learning new songs.  
  - Chord library should also be cleaned up and utilize functions that mimic the real world and industry standards.

## Scenarios and Journey Maps
### James' Scenario & Journey Map
**WHY James is using this product**
> James is currently working a 9 to 5 job as a physical therapist--an approximately 35 minute commute from home. He loves his role as a husband and father, and is excited for the memories ahead with his wife and 8 year old son. However, recently, by both personal decision and doctors' advice, James has decided to pick up a hobby to help him destress after work. He recalls all the fun he had learning instruments with his friends back in college, and decides to pick up the ukulele again. James has a lot going on with work and his family, so is in search of an easy/intuitive and low-stress environment when practicing the ukulele. His goal is to play at least 15 minutes a day after work, so he also requires an efficient way to pick up where he left off each practice session.  <br/>

**HOW James is using this product**
> James' coworker recommends to him the Ukulele App, suggesting that it is an efficient way to keep track of notes, sheet music, tutorials, etc. as all the necessary materials are on a single app. James decides to test the app out after he has had dinner and settled in after work. He goes to his office to find a quiet place to practice. He opens the app and decides to begin with learning chords. He locates a few video tutorials and watches them fully. When he finds a tutorial he likes, he decides to add it to his notebook. He taps the notebook icon in the upper right corner. A popup displays, requiring user input for the desired notebook he would like to add the entry to, the date, and any additional notes/descriptions. Once the notebook is formed and his entry is added, he navigates to the notebook to add typed and/or handwritten notes about lessons he struggled with or topics he wants to practice more. After about 20 minutes of watching video tutorials, James closes the app and makes a mental note that he will pick up where he left off for the most recent material added to his notebook.

### Michael's Scenario & Journey Map  
**WHY Michael is using this product**  
> Michael is currently working remote as an architect for a medium sized firm. After his children officially moved out and became independent adults, Michael has been feeling a bit bored and decides to find a way to fill his time. He and his wife decide to pick up instruments--the ukulele for Michael and the guitar for his wife. Michael has always been one to seek knowledge, however he isn't too tech savvy and can get easily overwhelemed by a ton of new and tedious information. This would be his first introduction to music ever, so he requires something with a simple and intuitive interface and maximum ease for learning the basics. Michael wants to pick this hobby up for fun, but does not want to dedicate a ton of money and resources to it. His daughter suggests using an app so that all his materials would be stored on a phone. She does abit of searching andrecommends him the Ukulele App. <br/>  

**HOW Michael is using this product**  
Michael begins his music journey by launching the app and reading the help/hints carefully. He decides to navigate to lessons and videos where he learns about the basic chords through video tutorials. Once he's gotten an introduction to the basics, he decides to take a stab at learning an easy song. Michael selects sheet music for a song, but quickly realizes he needs to learn understand chord variations to play the whole song well. He notices that the chord library tool is intended to inform users about all the potential variations. Michael opens the tool and is overwhelmed by the number of variations for C major alone (32 variations!). He is thinking about closing the app and putting his practice off for today, until he notices that he can select chords to add to a folder for a song he wishes to learn. Michael navigates to a chord variation, taps the folder icon, and comes to a popup asking for user input about the folder name and folder color. Michael adds a few variations for each chord required for the song. This makes his learning process much easier, as he is able to reference this folder while reading sheet music. Michael feels significantly less overwhelmed by an intimidating concept like chord variations. <br/>
