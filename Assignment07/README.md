## Overview
### Purpose
My project is focused on a redesign of the Ukulele App, a music learning app for novice and experienced ukulele players. The purpose of the redesign was to create a comfortable environment for music learning, as well as implement new intuitive features to help organize complicated music learning materials. An interactive high fidelity prototype is helpful in illustrating redesign ideas/features and gauging user responses. Cognitive walkthroughs, usability tests, etc. can be utilized in combination with prototypes to gain feedback and insight into the pros and cons of a redesign. Problems/errors and potential changes can be investigated from here. This process as a whole is beneficial in that you can gain valuable insight about a redesign without dedicating the time, money, and resources to coding a full working app. 
### Process
The high fidelity interactive prototype was created using Figma. The wireflow included finalized design elements such as color, text size and font, elemenet shapes, and spacing. These design choices were made using iterations of a low fidelity prototype and impression testing. Wireflows were illustrated using Autoflow and the high fidelity interactive prototype was created utilizing Figma's prototype feature.

## Tasks
1. Create a notebook to store notes, favorite videos, and other music learning materials
    - Create a new notebook and title it "Chord Notebook"
2. Add contents to a notebook
    - Access a video lesson for how to play the basic C major chord
    - Add the video to the recently created "Chord Notebook"
3. Add a chord variation to a chord group
    - Navigate to the chord library tool
    - View the third variation of C major
    - Add the third variation of C major to a new group
    - Name the new group "Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen"
4. View other chord variations
    - Access the popup menu for the chord library
    - Switch to view D minor

## Interactive Prototype
### [Iteration 1](https://www.figma.com/proto/XTNQjEGBevrlYfaMBBQryM/DH110-Prototype?node-id=69%3A14&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A10&starting-point-node-id=69%3A14&show-proto-sidebar=1)
### [Iteration 2](https://www.figma.com/proto/XTNQjEGBevrlYfaMBBQryM/DH110-Prototype?node-id=145%3A3737&scaling=scale-down&page-id=144%3A2601&starting-point-node-id=145%3A3737&show-proto-sidebar=1)

## In Class Cognitive Walkthrough
Cognitive walkthrough data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tThPG8LP-6KPscSL0mup9TFypyZj93hkZm_IgGI1C2U/edit?usp=sharing).  

Since we were limited on time due to class time constraints, the cognitive walkthrough process was very quick and simplified. This produced results that were likely not as detailed or accurate as they would be in a typical cognitive walkthrough. However, I did find a bit of useful feedback that I used in a second iteration. My participants found the design to be very intuitive and straightforward, and pointed out elements that they appreciated such as the help icon, minimalist design, and cancel/undo buttons. They noted that the navigation bar was immediately visible as well.

However, they expressed confusion about the general contents and purpose of the app on the first frame of the prototype (originally the notebook page). I had originally intended for the app to follow a similar format as apps like Instagram and Tiktok where the first state of interaction would be the page where the user likely left off in a previous interaction. In other words, the app would open to the notebook page, since this is where practice progress, video lessons, etc. could be stored. However, this can be confusing to novices of the app. For the second iteration, I added a loading/welcome page that would be visible prior to the notebook page.

In addition, one participant noted that a search bar could be helpful for the notebook page in the instance a user created a large catalog of notebooks. A search bar would prevent error or confusion in this instance.

I also adjusted padding/margins, text size, and alignment of a few of the elements as I went along. These changes were gradual, and thus not strictly visible in between iteration 1 and 2. The subtle differences can be seen in comparison to the [low fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/XTNQjEGBevrlYfaMBBQryM/DH110-Prototype?node-id=8%3A61), however.
