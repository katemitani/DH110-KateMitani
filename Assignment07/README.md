## Overview
### Purpose
My project is focused on a redesign of the Ukulele App, a music learning app for novice and experienced ukulele players. The purpose of the redesign was to create a comfortable environment for music learning, as well as implement new intuitive features to help organize complicated music learning materials. An interactive high fidelity prototype is helpful in illustrating redesign ideas/features and gauging user responses. Cognitive walkthroughs, usability tests, etc. can be utilized in combination with prototypes to gain feedback and insight into the pros and cons of a redesign. Problems/errors and potential changes can be investigated from here. This process as a whole is beneficial in that you can gain valuable insight about a redesign without dedicating the time, money, and resources to coding a full working app. 
### Process
The high fidelity interactive prototype was created using Figma. The wireflow included finalized design elements such as color, text size and font, elemenet shapes, and spacing. These design choices were made using iterations of a low fidelity prototype and impression testing. Wireflows were illustrated using Autoflow and the high fidelity interactive prototype was created utilizing Figma's prototype feature.

## Tasks
1. Create a notebook to store notes, favorite videos, and other music learning materials
    - Create a new notebook and title it "Chord Notebook"
2. Add contents to a notebook
    - Access a video lesson for how to play the basic C major chord
    - Add the video to the recently created "Chord Notebook"
3. Add a chord variation to a chord group
    - Navigate to the chord library tool
    - View the third variation of C major
    - Add the third variation of C major to a new group
    - Name the new group "Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen"
4. View other chord variations
    - Access the popup menu for the chord library
    - Switch to view D minor
