## Project Description
Music something that transcends langugages, distances, physical or metaphorical barriers. Music is something that can be enjoyed with little to no knowledge of the technicalities, however some may wish to dive deeper. With this project, I intend to create more coherent and consistent learning environments/experiences for those seeking to develop a new skill. While this project is carried out with the persona of a middle-aged man as the average user, I believe the design changes should be able to establish a pleasant and intuitive experience for all users. 

## Severity Ratings For Usability Problems - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
Each usability problem is rated using a scale based off the Nielson Norman Group severity rating scale for usability problems. These ratings take into account the **frequency** of the problem's occurance, the **impact** of the problem on the user, and the **persistence** of the problem throughout the user's process.
| Severity Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No Issues: well designed features |
| 1 | Cosmetic Problem: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: low priority to fix |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem; top priority to fix |

# Website/App #1: [Soundfly](https://soundfly.com/courses)
(![Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 6 57 11 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102703477/161880571-8e72bb08-79b9-46f6-8bc1-feb09fe3ef6b.png)
Soundfly is a website designed to help established and aspiring musicians, producers, artists, and songwriters expand upon their knowledge and skills through a series of online courses. Soundfly incorporates videos, quizzes, and instructional material developed by a team of expert instructors. Course topics range from writing, producing, and hustling to playing and discovering. Users are able to create a free account that provides them access to a wide range of courses. Subscriptions and mentorship programs are also purchasable but not required.

Soundfly has been regarded by many websites as one of the top music learning websites. While I was pleasantly surprised by the minimalist design and good use of signifiers, I felt as if this website exposed flaws the longer you interacted with it. For a website designed for long term usability and intended for users to continuously return, I believe there are some design and usability changes that can be made to improve user control + freedom and establish a system that gets better with use.  

## 1. Visibility of System Status
### The system should always keep users informed about what is going on through efficient feedback.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Text or cell highlights change color + mouse changes from an arrow to a pointer when hovering over clickable signifiers or text. This makes it clear where the user currently is, while subtle feedback indicates their possible options. | N/A |  
| 0 | Progress of course completion indicated on the side section (hamburger display) with checkmarks -- checkmarks for completed sections and current in-progress section highlighted in grey. Reminds users of what they've completed, where they currently are, and what is to come. | N/A |  
| 1 | When viewing one of the main pages (e.g. "Courses", "Blog", "About Us", etc.) there is no indicator of what page you are viewing. This leaves room for confusing about the current situation and next steps. | Would be helpful to highlight the cell or change the text color of the page that is currently being viewed, or display the words "Courses", "Blog", "About Us", etc. as a noticable title for each page. |  
| 2 | When on the home page for an in-progress course, there is no indication of completion status.  | One suggestion could be to add a progress bar at the top containing a visible representation of completion as well as a percentage. Check marks can also be utilized on the course info page similarly to how they are used on the in progress course pages. | <br/>

## 2. Match Between System + Real World
### The system should speak the user's langugage, use familiar concepts rather than system-oriented language, and make information appear in a natural + logical order.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Small but helpful detail: drop-down menus are marked with down arrows (▼) that change to up arrows (▲) when opened. Mimic natural and familiar understandings for most cultures. | N/A |  
| 2 | Titles of the course aren't the most approachable, especially for novices (e.g. "Faders Up II: Advanced Mix Techniques"). Can result in confusion about the material or discourage novices from interacting with these courses. | Similified titles that implement non-technical vocabulary should be utilized. For examples, some other courses with approachable titles are "Demo Recording 101" or "How to Make Your First Beat in Ableton Live". |  
| 3 | Courses are not presented in logical order. For example, for the course "How to Read Music", the "Previous" section links to the course "Building Blocks of Piano". However, on the main course page, "How to Read Music" is listed before the "Building Blocks of Piano" course. | Rearranging the courses to  mimic the suggested or logical order or providing indications such as "Part 1" and "Part 2" can provide a more intuitive process for users. | <br/>

## 3. User Control and Freedom
### Should contain clearly marked exits that allow users to leave unwanted states. Helpful in the common occurance of navigation slips and mistakes. Should support undo and redo, and limit the amount of extended dialogue. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | There is no way to clear your progress. In the instance of a user who accidentially marked a page as complete, or perhaps a user who wishes to retake a course, there is no opportunity to undo the content of their previous actions. | Provide a "Clear Progress" option on the course info page that applies to individual sections or a course as a whole. |  
| 3 | There is no "return to courses" section once you've selected a course. Similarly, when working on an in progress course, there are no clear indicators on how to return to a previous section (especially when the hamburger section is closed. This makes it difficult for users to undo errors after misclicks, and also limits their opportunities to further explore content. | Logical solutions would be to add a "Return to Courses" option that navigates back to the main course page, as well as a "Previous Page" option on each in progress course page. |  
| 3 | When working on an in progress course, there is no way to navigate to other tabs on the home page (i.e. "Courses", "Blog", "About Us", etc.). | An easy fix would be to keep the home page menu bar visible at all times for all pages. | <br/>

## 4. Consistency and Standards
### Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Common functions, symbols, etc. that are utilized in most systems should be consistent for your system as well.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | On the course info page, the timer and sections icons are not clickable. They mimic common signifiers but do not perform the expected function. Similarly, the sections under "Course Outline" on the course info page are not clickable. | Make these signifiers clickable, or alter their appearance to diverge from common signifiers. |  
| 1 | The keywords below the instructor profile on the course info page are nto clickable, but will highlight when hovered over with a mouse. | Change the shape or color so they no longer represent a typical keyword function bubble. |  
| 3 | When in the middle of a course, users are unable to click on the SOUNDFLY logo at the top to return to the main page. This is a standard that is largely consistent across all online platforms. The function is even present in other pages on the Soundfly website, however it does not work for the in progress course pages. | Make the logo clickable on the in progress course pages to redirect back to the home page. | <br/>

## 5. Error Prevention
### System should implement a careful design that prevents a problem from occuring in the first place. Rather than simply displaying an error message, system should eliminate error prone conditions, constantly check for errors, and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to an action.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | For the most part, Soundfly does not have much room for error. There is not a lot of user input required and the buttons to continue processes (i.e. "Done! What's Next?" button) are clear and communicate that you will be moving on to the next step. | Some minor improvement could be to implement a small message such as "Would you like to mark this section as complete?" with a "Do not show this message again." option. This reminds the user that this will permanently alter their progress records, but does not interfere too often with their user experience. | <br/>

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
### Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not be required to memorize information. Instructions should be visible or easily accessible when needed. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | On the main course page, there are no indicators of which courses the user has completed or made progress on. This requires the user to keep track of all the course they've accessed on their own. | Progress bars should be displayed at the top of each course. | <br/>

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
### Make accelerators hidden for novices but available for experts. Allows users to tailor frequent actions. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | The system does a good job of keeping the material approachable, but providing additional features for more "advanced" users who decide to purchase subscriptions or utilize resources like mentors. These features do no clutter the interface or interfere with learning of novices. | N/A |  
| 3 | There are no indications of difficulty levels for each course. Some are obvious as introductory courses or advanced courses, but some are more unclear. In addition, they are not sorted in any particular order. | Courses should indicate difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, hard, advanced) and sort them in ascending order. | <br/>

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
### The layout and presentation of information should be easy on the eye and only highlight important points.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | For the most part, the information is displayed appropriately, making the pages easy to navigate. For example, the courses display an informative title overlayed on top of a relevant but not-distracting graphic. When scrolled over with a mouse, a short course summary is displayed. | N/A |  
| 1 | The courses are not displayed in a very intuitive order, especially for beginners. | The courses could be rearranged to a more logical order such as Play, Write, Produce, Discover, Hustle. |  
| 1 | The course outline section is repetitive and not very informative. For example, the "How to Read Music" course displays the Section 5 outline simply as "Dots and Ties", "Recap of Dots and Ties", and "QUIZ: Test Yourself on Dots and Ties". | The sections could be renamed to more informative titles, or simply omitted altogether. | <br/>

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
### Error messages should be expressed in simple langugage, precisely identify the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | For the quizzes at the end of each course section, wrong answers are highlighted in red with the message "try again", however only some quiz questions display a hint at the correct answer. | System should display hints that are productive to users' learning. A helpful hint could be about where to nagivate to in the course to locate the material that discusses the correct answer. | <br/>

## 10. Help and Documentation
### Help should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. For example, the help and FAQ should be easily found and accessible.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | There is no search or help section available in any page of Soundfly. The closest feature is the "Contact Us" tab located at the footer of the page. This makes it difficult for users to seek solutions if they encounter a problem. There aren't many instructions either, meaning the learning process is expected to be highly intuitive. While it may work for a majority, it is bound to confuse others. | There should be an FAQ, help, and search section available at all times. A search bar would allow users to easily navigate to their desired material, and a help section would result in a less stressful learning environment/process for users. | <br/>


# Website/App #2: [The Ukulele App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.techdojo.The_Ukulele_App&hl=en_US&gl=US)  
![Screenshot 2022-04-05 at 7 00 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102703477/161880761-dfbefb38-ca4e-4ecb-8ede-b98b57484a35.png)
Created by famous Youtuber "The Ukulele Teacher," this app is designed for beginners seeking an introducion to playing the ukulele. The app contains a variety of videos to learn your favorite songs, a catalog of lessons to learn the basics of the ukulele, and a number of tools to assist with playing. 

Overall, I found this app to be extremely difficult to work with, especially as someone with no knowledge about music or the ukulele. S tince the app was created by the most popular ukuklele teacher on Youtube, the app consists primarily of his own Youtube videos. This results in a lot of features redirecting users to the Youtube app, often without warning. In addition, the controls tended to not be very intuitive, sometimes even diverging from industry and culural standards. I felt that there were a lot of aesthetic issues with the website design as well that could use a lot of work. While I believe the app has a lot of potential and good content, there are many areas that hinder a seamless user experience, primarily in regards to minimalist design, error prevention, and help + documentation. 

## 1. Visibility of System Status
### The system should always keep users informed about what is going on through efficient feedback.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | When tapping on an icon on the home page, it will very briefly darken in shade, indicating that it was successfully tapped. | N/A |  
| 3 | For some pages, it is unclear which section you are currently interacting with. Section titles such as "Videos" or "Tools" do not remain visible if you progress to a sub-section within it. | Should keep titles consistent throughout all pages. | <br/>

## 2. Match Between System + Real World
### The system should speak the user's langugage, use familiar concepts rather than system-oriented language, and make information appear in a natural + logical order.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | The icons for the main menu are pretty standard and familiar, however the icons within each sub-section is less clear. For example, the sub-sections for "latest", "uke blog", "sort by playlist", etc. are all the same icon (a play button in a circle). | It would be more effective to have icons that communicate the contents of each sub-section, such that it is clear that one contains a list of playlists, another contains all songs in the catalog in alphabetical order, etc. |
| 3 | The "Tools" are extremely unintuitive to learn, especially for beginners. Not only do they include very little instruction on how to operate each tool, but it also implements controls that do not mimic a real world guitar. For example, you have to tap, hold, and slide up and down to change between variations of a chord, and tap on a string to strum the note. | Controls that simulated a real guitar, such as swiping to strum would provide a more intuitive interface for users. | <br/>

## 3. User Control and Freedom
### Should contain clearly marked exits that allow users to leave unwanted states. Helpful in the common occurance of navigation slips and mistakes. Should support undo and redo, and limit the amount of extended dialogue. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A "back" arrow is present at every page in the upper left corner to return to a previous page. However, there is no way to return directly to the home page--instead the user is required to repeatedly tap the back arrow. | It would be more efficient to have an accessible button to return to the main home page, such as a logo along the top. | <br/>

## 4. Consistency and Standards
### Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Common functions, symbols, etc. that are utilized in most systems should be consistent for your system as well.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The search bar is not consistently present. Instead it is a sub-section within certain sections on the home page. | Can be improved by adding a search feature somewhere consistent such as the upper right hand corner. |
| 2 | Dialogue is not dismissible by an X like most users are familiar with. Instead, they are dismissible by icons such as a back arrow, clicking on a face icon, or tapping an "Ok" button. | It would be more consistent and familiar if all collapse/dismiss features were performed by tapping an X icon. 
| 1 | To access the main home page from the welcome page, you have to swipe up. Most apps utilize a tap function, or simply begin on the home page and omit a welcome page altogether. | If the developers would like to keep the welcome page for whatever reason, they could design it so that the welcome page loads for a few seconds before disappearing to be replaced by the main home page. The swipe function could also just be replaced by a tap function. | <br/>

## 5. Error Prevention
### System should implement a careful design that prevents a problem from occuring in the first place. Rather than simply displaying an error message, system should eliminate error prone conditions, constantly check for errors, and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to an action.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | Many of the videos listed on the website are unavailable on the actual app, and instead redirect the user to the Youtube app. There is no confirmation required before the app switches to the Youtube app. This is inefficient and inconvenient for a user, who most likely would prefer to have all the content available to them on one app. | A solution would be to reprogram the app to establish a more accessible library of available videos. If it is necessary to redirect users to the Youtube app, a notification or confirmation dialogue box would be beneficial for the user. |  
| 3 |  Many of the features (primarily the tools) notify users that they must purchase a $1.99 PRO upgrade to continue using the feature. If the user has not purchased the PRO option and attempts to use the feature, it displays a message that notifies them of the issue. However, the options to dismiss this notification are "Ok" and "Maybe Later". "Ok", which is often utilized as a dismiss button, instead prompts a payment request that, if misclicked, could result in a user paying for a feature they did not intend to purchase. | One solution could be to change the wording of the options to something more straightforward such as "Purchase Now" and "Maybe Later." Including keywords with connotations of payment/money are less likely to result in slips. |  
| 3 | The search function does not contain any recommendations, suggestions, or clues as to what is searchable. This is problematic when taking into account issues like spelling errors or typos, which produce an error message rather than offering suggestions similar to the user's input. | One suggestion would be to add automatic suggestions in the search bar, similar to Google or Youtube searches. This could provide context as to what is searchable on the app. In addition, there should be suggestions for similar searches in the case of inaccuarate user input or absence of the desired content on the app. | <br/>

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
### Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not be required to memorize information. Instructions should be visible or easily accessible when needed. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | When accessing video or lesson content, it is unclear which section of the app you are viewing. Instead, only the title of the current lesson/video is displayed, while other section and subsection titles are omitted. | It could be useful to implement a display that reminds users which section they are currently viewing. | 
| 3 | The tools such as chord finder or scale library are all inaccessible when viewing the videos or lessons on the app. This requires users to memorize scales, chords, etc. before viewing any of the learning content. | One solutions would be to allow these features to coexist on the app, or to encorporate them somehow into the video or lesson content. | <br/>

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
### Make accelerators hidden for novices but available for experts. Allows users to tailor frequent actions. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | There is no way for users to seek a sense of definable progress within the app. There are no completion statuses, challenges, etc. that can encourage novices to keep learning while reminding experts of their progress and development. | A good solutions would be to add a completion/progress bar at the top of each category that fill depending on how many videos users watch. "Completion" of a section could be determined by something like a quiz at the end. There could also be check marks or indicators by videos or lessons that participants have already viewed and/or completed. |
| 2 | There are very few features that are hidden for novices but available for experts. Most of these features require purchase. However, one of the main issues is that, while the tools are very useful, they are very overwhelming for users who are unfamiliar with ukulele, sheet music, or chords, keys, etc. | There could be a more simple interface for the tools that can be tailored to be more complicated/advanced for non-novices. | <br/>

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
### The layout and presentation of information should be easy on the eye and only highlight important points.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | I, along with many reviewers, have found the interface design to be very unappealing and outdated. The fonts are not very clean, appear unprofessional and undeveloped, and do not work well with other fonts used on the app. The color scheme is unattractive, and the presentation of information can be cluttered. | Although it is not necessarily a problem in terms of user's ability to interact with the app effectively, it is a cosmetic change that can be easily addressed by implementing new color schemes, fonts, and icon designs to fit a more modern and minimalist approach. |
## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors

| 3 | When inputting something into the search function, an error message stating "No results found!" will appear if the input text does not match directly with any text in the app's content. | A more constructive error message would be one that provides suggestions about related searches or suggests the user retype and/or check spelling. | <br/>

## 10. Help and Documentation

| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | There is no FAQ, contact us for help, etc. within the app. | There should be a way for novice users to access a more extensive help page, not only for app usability, but also for the content (music learning). |  
| 3 | While the help is always accessible from most pages (logo in the upper right corner), the text is extremely lengthy and uniform. | The help could be shorter as well as utilize bolding and spacing instead of displaying the information in paragraph form. Visuals can also be helpful, especially for instructions on how to utilize tools like the tuner. | <br/>
