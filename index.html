            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Music is something that transcends languages, distances, and physical or metaphorical barriers. It is something that can be enjoyed with little to no knowledge of the technicalities. However, some may wish to dive deeper in efforts to find further enjoyment, develop a new hobby/skill, or to improve their general wellbeing in areas such as cognitive ability or mental health.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers and academics have studied the effects of music and instrument skills on the brain, and uncovered some impressive findings.<span style="font-weight: 700;">

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get the most out of music, learning an instrument should be fun and relaxing, not a burden. With this project, I redesigned the Ukulele App--one of the most popular ukulele-learning apps available. The goal of the project was to create more intuitive and consistent learning environments/experiences for those seeking to develop their music abilities.</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;">the process of user experience evaluation and testing, I identified a few usability concerns for the Ukulele App. To begin, the app contains a lot of information but is difficult and time consuming to navigate. For example, many of the resources are nested within pages, requiring a user to undo/return multiple times to navigate back to the main home page or switch to a different page. In addition, the app makes it difficult to document progress or keep track of favorite materials. Finally, there are a few usability concerns relating to divergence from industry standards and real world controls. In my project, I aim to eliminate these concerns to create a more intuitive interface that supports an optimal learning environment.&nbsp;</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;"> first step of my UX research was to analyze the Ukulele App and a competitor website (Soundfly.com) to identify key characteristics of a system with good usability. This process was conducted using 10 heuristics identified by usability consultants Rolf Molich and Jakob Nielsen.&nbsp;My heuristic evaluation of the Ukulele App provided a good foundation for my project by uncovering key usability issues that could be addressed in a redesign. The heuristic evaluation revealed issues ranging from minor things like aesthetic design and color scheme to major usability concerns such as minimal user error prevention. My chosen competitor website Soundfly, a general music learning website, focuses heavily on structured learning and progress. My heuristic evaluation of Soundfly provided a great insight into how the Ukulele App could be redesigned to balance both music tools/resources as well as lessons and tutorials.</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;"> testing allows researchers and designers to gain insight into how an average user interacts with the app. This process is key in identifying where confusion, errors, or concerns manifest in a user’s interaction. Based on my heuristic evaluation, I identified three major usability issues. I created tasks related to these issues to gain insight into how they may affect a user. My usability test, conducted via Zoom, investigated a user’s ability to interact with the Ukulele App’s tool features as well as locate specific information throughout the app. In addition, I collected evidence of the user’s thoughts, feelings, and perceptions of the app.&nbsp;</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;">My usability test revealed a few interesting findings that aligned with my heuristic evaluation. The participant found some features to be unintuitive, and was only able to complete certain tasks after trial and error or discovering things by accident. Many of the pauses in process that occurred stemmed from unintuitive controls and features that diverged from industry standards. In addition, the participant noted that the interface itself felt unprofessional and busy in terms of design.&nbsp;</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;"> next step of the human centered design process was to gather insight about effective music learning processes in order to curate optimal functions and experiences for a music learning app. This process utilized qualitative research methods including an interview and contextual inquiry. After identifying my target audience (middle-aged men independently learning the ukulele), I developed questions and tasks to investigate what a real user would look for in this type of app.&nbsp;</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon reflection, I developed a better understanding of how to adjust the usability of the app to cater toward real music learners. Rather than readjusting the design based on general interface usability and design, I generated new ideas to create an efficient learning environment. For example, my participant (a ukulele beginner with a long history of piano experience) described how he utilized ukulele chord libraries to catalog chords he would need to play a particular song. This led me to formulate a feature for grouping chords rather than having to document them independently from the app. In addition, my participant described his process of a typical practice session, contributing to my implementation of a notebook feature that would allow users to track their progress, maintain a point to pick up where they left off, and document any notes.</span></b>

UX storytelling helps research and design teams stay on the same page and promotes decisions that cater to an average user.

Based on my personas, I decided to focus on <span style="font-weight: 700;">three</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">main features</span>:<br>1.&nbsp; A notebook feature that would allow users to keep track of their favorite materials on the app, add notes, and track their learning progress<br>2.&nbsp; A “chord grouping” feature that would allow users to minimize stress when viewing an overwhelming amount of new information. The group feature would allow users to separate any material that they wish to review, document, or save for later.<br>3.&nbsp; A more intuitive design for the “chord library” tool that more closely matches the real world and industry standards
                          </span></b>
                        <br>
                        <br><b>
                          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                            <span style="font-weight: 700;">
                              <span style="font-weight: 400;">These features were broken down into</span>&nbsp;four tasks
                            </span>:
                          </span></b>
                        <br><b>
                          <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.&nbsp; Create a new notebook<br>2.&nbsp; Add a tutorial to the notebook<br>3.&nbsp; Add a chord to a new group<br>4.&nbsp; View the variations of a different chord in the chord library tool
                          </span></b>
                        <br>
                        <br><b>
                          <span style="font-weight: 400;">Once my tasks were well-incorporated into a wireframe, I conducted prototype testing with a low fidelity prototype. This process revealed important insight into how efficiently a user would be able to utilize and understand my design features. For example, my participant noted it took him a while to notice an icon that I wanted to be very visible. With this in mind, I changed the presentation of icons and information in a second iteration. He also found some of the labels to be confusing in terms of wording. In the second iteration I renamed buttons and added captions to certain elements.&nbsp;</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;">gaining user feedback, I incorporated new changes to an interactive low fidelity prototype. In the next step of the human centered design process, I focused on design decisions and graphic design accessibility. This process included adjusting font size and element spacing, developing color schemes, testing variations of typography and shape, and running color contrast checkers to ensure proper visual accessibility. Impression tests allowed me to refine my design decisions to produce a final version that I would apply to a high fidelity prototype.</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;"> on my wireframing, interface design, and low fidelity prototype, I utilized Figma to create an interactive high fidelity prototype.&nbsp;</span></b>

                          <span style="font-weight: 400;">Once my high fidelity prototype was functional and incorporated all the necessary revisions and design choices, I ran a cognitive walkthrough on two classmates. Based on their feedback, I implemented a few additional elements for a second iteration. These changes included adding a welcome/loading page that included the title and logo of the Ukulele App, as well as a search function for the notebook feature. My cognitive walkthrough participants specified that a welcome page would be helpful for informing new users about the contents of the app, and that a search function would be beneficial for more experienced users (i.e. someone who has created many notebooks and would like to search easily for one in their collection).&nbsp;</span></b>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></b><b>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">this class project, I had experience with quantitative analysis and qualitative user research methods, but lacked experience with UX design principles. As someone who is just getting their foot in the door to the field of UX, I really enjoyed the entire process of this project, and it has excited me for a potential future career in UX research.</span></b>
          <br>
          <br><b>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">A concept that has always been stressed is that UX research and design is an iterative process--and I definitely discovered this throughout the timeline of this project. It was interesting to see how much thought and detail-oriented decision making goes into just one small interaction with a product. In a large-scale project, it is clear that there are so many human-centered design concepts to consider.</span></b>
          <br>
          <br><b>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">One difficulty that I faced was generating ideas that would benefit the user without taking away from the app creator’s vision. For example, the app creator (a popular Ukulele Youtuber) may have intended for his app to be a complementary resource to his Youtube channel rather than an app that would support the entire ukulele-learning process on its own. In addition, since this was a very small-scale project, working with just a few participants for user feedback, it was difficult to gauge whether or not my design changes accurately represented what a larger population would desire. Finally, since this was more of an introductory course, I recognize that there are differences between my process and that of an industry professional. However, I think I learned a lot about the general methodologies and design principles that I would need to work on a more advanced project. I’m glad to have learned about the process of wireframing and prototyping on Figma as well, and look forward to opportunities to develop these skills in the future.&nbsp;</span></b>
