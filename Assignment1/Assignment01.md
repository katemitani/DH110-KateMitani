## Severity Ratings For Usability Problems - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
Each usability problem is rated using a scale based off the Nielson Norman Group severity rating scale for usability problems. These ratings take into account the **frequency** of the problem's occurance, the **impact** of the problem on the user, and the **persistence** of the problem throughout the user's process.
| Severity Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No Issues: well designed features |
| 1 | Cosmetic Problem: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: low priority to fix |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem; top priority to fix |

## 1. Visibility of System Status
### The system should always keep users informed about what is going on through efficient feedback.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Text or cell highlights change color + mouse changes from an arrow to a pointer when hovering over clickable signifiers or text | N/A |  
| 0 | Progress of course completion indicated on the side section (hamburger display) with checkmarks -- checkmarks for completed sections and current in-progress section highlighted in grey. | N/A |  
| 1 | When viewing one of the main pages (e.g. "Courses", "Blog", "About Us", etc.) there is no indicator of what page you are viewing. | Would be helpful to highlight the cell or change the text color of the page that is currently being viewed, or display the words "Courses", "Blog", "About Us", etc. as a noticable title for each page. |  
| 3 | When on the home page for an in-progress course, there is no indication of completion status | One suggestion could be to add a progress bar at the top containing a visible representation of completion as well as a percentage. Check marks can also be utilized on the course home page similarly to how they are used on the actual course pages. | <br/>
