## Severity Ratings For Usability Problems - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
Each usability problem is rated using a scale based off the Nielson Norman Group severity rating scale for usability problems. These ratings take into account the **frequency** of the problem's occurance, the **impact** of the problem on the user, and the **persistence** of the problem throughout the user's process.
| Severity Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No Issues: well designed features |
| 1 | Cosmetic Problem: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: low priority to fix |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem; top priority to fix |

## 1. Visibility of System Status
### The system should always keep users informed about what is going on through efficient feedback.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Text or cell highlights change color + mouse changes from an arrow to a pointer when hovering over clickable signifiers or text. This makes it clear where the user currently is, while subtle feedback indicates their possible options. | N/A |  
| 0 | Progress of course completion indicated on the side section (hamburger display) with checkmarks -- checkmarks for completed sections and current in-progress section highlighted in grey. Reminds users of what they've completed, where they currently are, and what is to come. | N/A |  
| 1 | When viewing one of the main pages (e.g. "Courses", "Blog", "About Us", etc.) there is no indicator of what page you are viewing. This leaves room for confusing about the current situation and next steps. | Would be helpful to highlight the cell or change the text color of the page that is currently being viewed, or display the words "Courses", "Blog", "About Us", etc. as a noticable title for each page. |  
| 2 | When on the home page for an in-progress course, there is no indication of completion status.  | One suggestion could be to add a progress bar at the top containing a visible representation of completion as well as a percentage. Check marks can also be utilized on the course info page similarly to how they are used on the in progress course pages. | <br/>
## 2. Match Between System + Real World
### The system should speak the user's langugage, use familiar concepts rather than system-oriented language, and make information appear in a natural + logical order.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Small but helpful detail: drop-down menus are marked with down arrows (▼) that change to up arrows (▲) when opened. Mimic natural and familiar understandings for most cultures. | N/A |  
| 2 | Titles of the course aren't the most approachable, especially for novices (e.g. "Faders Up II: Advanced Mix Techniques"). Can result in confusion about the material or discourage novices from interacting with these courses. | Similified titles that implement non-technical vocabulary should be utilized. For examples, some other courses with approachable titles are "Demo Recording 101" or "How to Make Your First Beat in Ableton Live". |  
| 3 | Courses are not presented in logical order. For example, for the course "How to Read Music", the "Previous" section links to the course "Building Blocks of Piano". However, on the main course page, "How to Read Music" is listed before the "Building Blocks of Piano" course. | Rearranging the courses to  mimic the suggested or logical order or providing indications such as "Part 1" and "Part 2" can provide a more intuitive process for users. | <br/>
## 3. User Control and Freedom
### Should contain clearly marked exits that allow users to leave unwanted states. Helpful in the common occurance of navigation slips and mistakes. Should support undo and redo, and limit the amount of extended dialogue. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | There is no way to clear your progress. In the instance of a user who accidentially marked a page as complete, or perhaps a user who wishes to retake a course, there is no opportunity to undo the content of their previous actions. | Provide a "Clear Progress" option on the course info page that applies to individual sections or a course as a whole. |  
| 3 | There is no "return to courses" section once you've selected a course. Similarly, when working on an in progress course, there are no clear indicators on how to return to a previous section (especially when the hamburger section is closed. This makes it difficult for users to undo errors after misclicks, and also limits their opportunities to further explore content. | Logical solutions would be to add a "Return to Courses" option that navigates back to the main course page, as well as a "Previous Page" option on each in progress course page. |  
| 3 | When working on an in progress course, there is no way to navigate to other tabs on the home page (i.e. "Courses", "Blog", "About Us", etc.). | An easy fix would be to keep the home page menu bar visible at all times for all pages. | <br/>
## 4. Consistency and Standards
### Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Common functions, symbols, etc. that are utilized in most systems should be consistent for your system as well.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | On the course info page, the timer and sections icons are not clickable. They mimic common signifiers but do not perform the expected function. Similarly, the sections under "Course Outline" on the course info page are not clickable. | Make these signifiers clickable, or alter their appearance to diverge from common signifiers. |  
| 1 | The keywords below the instructor profile on the course info page are nto clickable, but will highlight when hovered over with a mouse. | Change the shape or color so they no longer represent a typical keyword function bubble. |  
| 3 | When in the middle of a course, users are unable to click on the SOUNDFLY logo at the top to return to the main page. This is a standard that is largely consistent across all online platforms. The function is even present in other pages on the Soundfly website, however it does not work for the in progress course pages. | Make the logo clickable on the in progress course pages to redirect back to the home page. | <br/>
## 5. Error Prevention
### System should implement a careful design that prevents a problem from occuring in the first place. Rather than simply displaying an error message, system should eliminate error prone conditions, constantly check for errors, and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to an action.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | For the most part, Soundfly does not have much room for error. There is not a lot of user input required and the buttons to continue processes (i.e. "Done! What's Next?" button) are clear and communicate that you will be moving on to the next step. | Some minor improvement could be to implement a small message such as "Would you like to mark this section as complete?" with a "Do not show this message again." option. This reminds the user that this will permanently alter their progress records, but does not interfere too often with their user experience. | <br/>
