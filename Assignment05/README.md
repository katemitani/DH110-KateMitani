## Project Overview
### Purpose
The goal of this project is to improve users' experiences with learning music. In particular, I wanted to improve the Ukulele App, a mobile app containing video tutorials and tools for ukulele learners/musicians. Based on previously conducted user research as well the development of personas and usage scenarios, I identified a few features that I hope to implement in a redesign to create a more intuitive and user-friendly app. Low fidelity prototyping will assist me in identifying if my redesigns/features are beneficial and intuitive to users. User walkthroughs of a low fidelity prototype can reveal any usability errors in my redesign, as well as reveal ideas for the features that I hadn't originally thought of. In addition, it is an effective way to step into the mind of an average user rather than from the perspective of a UX researcher/designer.  
### Personas & Usage Scenarios
I established two personas to identify a few key characteristics of my target demographic: middled aged men (often fathers) seeking to pick up a new hobby for self improvement, not very tech-savvy, very busy, desire something accessible and time/cost friendly. They would require methods of learning that can be easily put down and picked up, and do not require excessive amounts of materials.  
Full personas and usage scenarios can be found [here](https://github.com/katemitani/DH110-Spring22/tree/main/Assignment04).
### Features & Tasks
The features and tasks that this low fidelity prototype would support were established based on previous user research of the Ukulele App, including usability tests, contextual inquiry, and heuristic evaluations. These features are intended to assist users by allowing them to track their progress, store notes and important materials within the app, and utilize tools in an efficient and intuitive way. 
1. A notebook app that would allow users to keep track of their favorite video tutorials on the app, add notes, and track their learning progress
2. A "chord grouping" feature that would allow users to minimize stress when viewing an overwhelming amount of new information. The group feature would allow users to note any difficult material that they wish to review, document, or save for later. 
3. A more intuitive design for the "chord library" tool that more closely matches the real world and industry standards.
