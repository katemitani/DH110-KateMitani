## Project Overview
### Purpose
The goal of this project is to improve users' experiences with learning music. In particular, I wanted to improve the Ukulele App, a mobile app containing video tutorials and tools for ukulele learners/musicians. Based on previously conducted user research as well the development of personas and usage scenarios, I identified a few features that I hope to implement in a redesign to create a more intuitive and user-friendly app. Low fidelity prototyping will assist me in identifying if my redesigns/features are beneficial and intuitive to users. User walkthroughs of a low fidelity prototype can reveal any usability errors in my redesign, as well as reveal ideas for the features that I hadn't originally thought of. In addition, it is an effective way to step into the mind of an average user rather than from the perspective of a UX researcher/designer.  
### Personas & Usage Scenarios
I established two personas to identify a few key characteristics of my target demographic: middle-aged men (often fathers) seeking to pick up a new hobby for self improvement, not very tech-savvy, very busy, desire something accessible and time/cost friendly. They would require methods of learning that can be easily put down and picked up, and do not require excessive amounts of materials.  
Full personas and usage scenarios can be found [here](https://github.com/katemitani/DH110-Spring22/tree/main/Assignment04).
### Features & Tasks
The features and tasks that this low fidelity prototype would support were established based on previous user research of the Ukulele App, including usability tests, contextual inquiry, and heuristic evaluations. These features are intended to assist users by allowing them to track their progress, store notes and important materials within the app, and utilize tools in an efficient and intuitive way. 
1. A notebook feature that would allow users to keep track of their favorite video tutorials on the app, add notes, and track their learning progress
2. A "chord grouping" feature that would allow users to minimize stress when viewing an overwhelming amount of new information. The group feature would allow users to note any difficult material that they wish to review, document, or save for later. 
3. A more intuitive design for the "chord library" tool that more closely matches the real world and industry standards.

## Reflection
What went smoothly
> I really enjoyed the process of creating prototypes and illustrating the feature designs that I had imagined while creating my personas/usage scenarios. I was satisfied with the wireflow I had anticipated my participant to make. While preparing for my participant test, I was concerned that my participant wouldn't gain an accurate understanding of the feature's purpose, however he was able to implement the actions I had anticipated without much guidance. For my first task, I had included a few additional wireframes in case my participant took the wrong action, however he did end up choosing the actions that resulted in the least amount of time, thus indicating that the feature is relatively straightforward.  

What went differently than expected
> One of the main usability errors that appeared to stand out was the visibility of important information that I wanted the user to notice. For example, for task 1 (create a new notebook), I had my user start from the main home screen. He failed to immediately notice the notebook icon in the upper right hand corner, and rather thought to click on the "tools" feature. This provides insight into how completely new users to the Ukulele App may interpret the features of the app. In a similar vein, my participant stalled a lot on task 2 (find variation 3 of the C major chord and add it to a group). He didn't notice the "1/32" in the bottom section underneath the "C Major" title, thus he didn't understand what the "1/32", "2/32" and "3/32" above the arrows meant. He eventually figured it out, but it took a bit of time for him to scan the rest of the features and infer what the arrows meant. In retrospect, this may be a problem for novices who are unfamiliar with the fact that there are many variations to view for each chord.  

What changes I would make to my prototype
> 1. Create an additional icon on the homepage (under "Lessons" and above "Tools") to access the notebook feature. This would be more intuitive, since a new user is likely to scan these items before looking in the upper right corner for the notebook and help icons.  
> 2. Add a "done" or "create" button to finalize the notebook entry. This is more obvious, but was simply a feature I forgot to implement in my mockup of the prototype.  
> 3. For the chord library tool, make a few of the important texts larger and more noticeable (e.g. the number of variations below the chord title).  
> 4. Add subtitles "next chord" and "previous chord" to the arrows that switch between chord variations.  
> 5. For the grouping function, change the wording of "add chord" to "add to group." My user was confused about the point of "view group." I intended the feature to be there when a user wanted to simply view a group that they had already created, but could not figure out if this should be separate from the icon that would allow the user to also create a new group. I think that differentiating between "view groups" and "add to group" will provide a bit more clarity of the feature's intentions.
